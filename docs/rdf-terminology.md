# RDF Terminology

## Terms defined in [RDF 1.1 Concepts](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/):

* [base IRI](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#dfn-base-iri) — An IRI that may represent the location against which [Relative IRIs](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#dfn-relative-iri) are resolved. In most concrete serialization formats this defaults to the location of the file containing RDF source.
* [Blank node identifier](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#dfn-blank-node-identifier) — Blank node identifiers are local identifiers that are used in some [concrete RDF syntaxes](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#dfn-concrete-rdf-syntax) or RDF store implementations. They are always locally scoped to the file or RDF store, and are not persistent or portable identifiers for blank nodes.
* [Blank node](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#dfn-blank-node) — Blank nodes are disjoint from [IRIs](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#dfn-internationalized-resource-identifier) and [literals](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#dfn-rdf-literal). Blank nodes are like simple variables in algebra; they represent some thing without saying what their value is.
* [Concrete RDF syntax](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#dfn-concrete-rdf-syntax) — An RDF document is a document that encodes an [RDF graph](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#dfn-rdf-graph) or [RDF dataset](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#dfn-rdf-dataset) in a concrete RDF syntax, such as Turtle [[RDF12-TURTLE](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#bib-rdf12-turtle)], RDFa [[RDFA-PRIMER](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#bib-rdfa-primer)], JSON-LD [[JSON-LD11](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#bib-json-ld11)], or TriG [[RDF12-TRIG](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-concepts/spec/#bib-rdf12-trig)].

* [Skolemization](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-semantics/spec/#dfn-skolemization) — Skolemization is a transformation on RDF graphs which eliminates blank nodes by replacing them with "new" IRIs, which means IRIs which are coined for this purpose and are therefore guaranteed to not occur in any other RDF graph (at the time of creation). 
* [Standardize](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-semantics/spec/#dfn-standardize) — When graphs are formed by combining RDF from multiple sources, it may be necessary to standardize apart the blank node identifiers by replacing them by others which do not occur in the other document(s).
