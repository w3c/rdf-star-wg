People in the working group have differing technical and non-technical backgrounds.   If you use an acronym or mention some system or formalism be prepared to explain or point to somewhere that defines what you are talking about.   To help working group members I am starting this page as a place to put pointers to introductions to and definitions of systems and expansions of acronyms.

# Acronyms
